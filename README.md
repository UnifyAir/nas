# 5G NAS (Non-Access Stratum) Protocol Library

A comprehensive implementation of the 5G Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocol based on 3GPP Technical Specification TS 24.501. This library provides tools and utilities for working with 5G NAS protocol messages, procedures, and security features.

## Overview

The Non-Access Stratum (NAS) is a functional layer in the 5G protocol stack that handles signaling and traffic between the User Equipment (UE) and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF). This library implements the NAS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501, providing a robust foundation for 5G network applications.

## Features

- Complete implementation of 5G NAS protocol messages and procedures
- Support for NAS security features (integrity protection and ciphering)
- Registration and mobility management procedures
- Session management functionality
- PDU session handling
- UE configuration update procedures
- Support for various 5G security algorithms

## Technical Specifications

This implementation is based on the following 3GPP specifications:
- TS 24.501: Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS)
